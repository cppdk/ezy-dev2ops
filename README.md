# ezy-dev2ops
This is a repository that represents a product which comprises a simple sample microservice and corresponding administrative client.

ezy-dev2ops is a repository containing a sample product setup created for organizations that want to get started with development and deployment in an easy way. The thinking is to create a "complete" starting setup comprising a REST service and an administrative client in each their repository.

The goal of this repository is to contain the product management parts, which you can implement and agile setup, having sprint boards, features, backlog, etc.

Each of the adjacent repositories containing the REST service and the administrative client will demonstrate continuous build and DevOps as they progress.

This file will be updated as the repositories progress.
